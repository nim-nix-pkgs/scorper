# SCORPER  ![Build Status](https://github.com/bung87/scorper/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

[travis]: https://travis-ci.org/bung87/scorper.svg?branch=master

**Elegant, performant, asynchronous micro web framework written in Nim**  

Built using [chronos](https://github.com/status-im/nim-chronos.git) and other powerful libraries.


**Note**: `scorper` is built using `chronos` which implements an `async`/`await` paradigm that is, at its core, different and therefore incompatible with the nim std library `asyncdispatch`'s `async`; this conflict is irresolvable and you will have to ensure your project dependencies support chronos async/await (note: many libraries do offer this, often using a compiler switch).     

> `scorper` will self contain manageable dependency source code for accelerated development.  

## Compiler flags  

### -ssl

Compile with: `-d:ssl`  

Then, using the proc `newScorper`, you will need to pass `isSecurity = true`,`privateKey`, `certificate` 

### Other

``` nim
const GzipEnable {.booldefine.} = true 
const HttpRequestBufferSize* {.intdefine.} = 2.Kb
const HttpServer {.strdefine.} = "scorper"
const TimeOut {.intdefine.} = 300 # in seconds  
const HttpHeadersLength* {.intdefine.} = int(HttpRequestBufferSize / 32) 
# 32 is sizeof MofuHeader
const gzipMinLength* {.intdefine.} = 20
```

## Usage  

details see here [usage](./USAGE.md)  

### hello world  

### `serve` with callback  

``` nim
import scorper

const port{.intdefine.} = 8888

proc cb(req: Request) {.async.} =
  ## See Request type to see fields accessible by callbacks

  let headers = {"Content-type": "text/plain"}
  await req.resp("Hello, World!", headers.newHttpHeaders())

when isMainModule:
  let address = "127.0.0.1:" & $port

  waitFor serve(address, cb)
  ## waitFor is a chronos implementation
  ## See chronos for options around executing async procs
```

### `newScorper` with router or callback  

<!---
Requires a more specific example aimed specifically at introducing router;
simultaneous introduction of the serve static and flags {ReuseAddr} require
documentation/explanation
--->

<!---
neatify example
--->

``` nim
when isMainModule:
  let r = newRouter[ScorperCallback]()
  # Relys on `StaticDir` environment variable
  r.addRoute(serveStatic, "get", "/static/*$")
  let address = "127.0.0.1:8888"
  let flags = {ReuseAddr}
  var server = newScorper(address, r, flags)
  server.start()
  waitFor server.join()
``` 

### use `route` pragma

<!---
Chore: requires better documentation and explanation
--->
``` nim
proc handler(req: Request) {.route("get","/one"),async.} = discard
proc handler2(req: Request) {.route(["get","post"],"/multi"),async.} = discard
let r = newRouter[ScorperCallback]()
r.addRoute(handler)
r.addRoute(handler2)
```

#### use `route` with `mount` macro  

<!---
Chore: requires better documentation and explanation
--->

``` nim
import ./my_controler
let r = newRouter[ScorperCallback]()
r.mount(my_controler)
```  

### responds depends on request mime  

``` nim
import scorper

proc cb(req: Request) {.async.} =
  var headers = newHttpHeaders()
  acceptMime(req, ext, headers):
    ## The template will automatically define the second parameter

    case ext
    of "html": await req.resp("Hello World", headers)
    of "txt": await req.resp("Hello World", headers)
    else:
      headers["Content-Type"] = "text/html"
      await req.resp("Hello World", headers)

when isMainModule:
  let address = "127.0.0.1:8888"
  waitFor serve(address, cb)
```

### Middleware  

<!---
Chore: include a bit more 
--->

Middleware can be implemented by importing `scorper/scorpermacros` (the import and definition of your middleware procedures **MUST** occur before importing scorper; see the note labeled *IMPORTANT* below)

>#### preMiddleware
>
>Procedure that is injected after the Request object fields are filled but BEFORE your callback.
>
>#### postMiddleware
>
>Procedure that is injected AFTER your callback (and therefore after your *response*).

#### Declaring middleware:

```nim
import scorper/scorpermacros

proc middleWare(req: Request): Future[bool] {.async, postMiddleware.} =
  ## Do things here
  return false
  ## return false to prevent calling the next middleware
```

Middleware procedures return `bool` to indicate whether to continue the call-chain to the next middleware.  

see [tmiddleware.nim](tests/tmiddleware.nim) for more

## Types  

``` nim 
type
  Request* = ref object
    meth*: HttpMethod
    headers*: HttpHeaders
    protocol*: tuple[major, minor: int]
    url*: Url
    path*: string              # http req path
    hostname*: string
    ip*: string
    params*: Table[string, string]
    query*: seq[(string, string)]
  ScorperCallback* = proc (req: Request): Future[void] {.closure, gcsafe.}
  Scorper* = ref object of StreamServer
    # inherited (partial)
    sock*: AsyncFD                # Socket
    local*: TransportAddress      # Address
    status*: ServerStatus         # Current server status
    flags*: set[ServerFlags]      # Flags
    errorCode*: OSErrorCode
  MiddlewareProc* = proc (req: Request): Future[bool]
```

## Error handling & Exception effects

As [`scorper`](https://github.com/bung87/scorper) make use of [`chronos`](https://github.com/status-im/nim-chronos) for asynchronous procedures, the handling of errors and exceptions within this paradigm are of relevance.

> `chronos` currently offers minimal support for exception effects and `raises`
annotations. In general, during the `async` transformation, a generic
`except CatchableError` handler is added around the entire function being
transformed, in order to catch any exceptions and transfer them to the `Future`.
>
> Effectively, this means that while code can be compiled with
`{.push raises: [Defect]}`, the intended effect propagation and checking is
**disabled** for `async` functions.
>
> To enable checking exception effects in `async` code, enable strict mode with
**`-d:chronosStrictException`**.
>
> In the strict mode, `async` functions are checked such that they only raise
`CatchableError` and thus must make sure to explicitly specify exception
effects on forward declarations, callbacks and methods using
`{.raises: [CatchableError].}` (or more strict) annotations.

See `chronos` [#Error handling](https://github.com/status-im/nim-chronos#error-handling) for more details.

Use `-d:chronosStrictException` to enable strict mode as explained above.

### Conclusion

*Scorper* is almost ten thousands faster than `jester` with stdlib.  It is even a thousand times faster than `asynchttpserver`

## Misc features/limitations  

The `mofuparser` use `SIMD` which relys on cpu support `SSE` or `AVX` instructions
